## Esmerald admin for [Saffier][saffier] ORM

Esmerald admin is a flexible user interface for [Saffier ORM][saffier] built on the top of the
already existing and highly maintained [SQLAdmin][sqladmin].

The main goal, as the name of the package says, is to provide a nice, flexible and easy to use
user interface that interacts with [Saffier ORM][saffier] in a more friendly manner.

## Saffier

[Saffier][saffier] is a flexible and powerfull ORM built on the top of SQLAlchemy core that allows
you to interact with almost every single SQL database out there in an asynchronous mode.

### Documentation

Majority of the documentation for this package **can and should** be seen in the [SQLAdmin][sqladmin]
official documentation (don't forget to leave a star on that repository) as the core remains exactly
the same.

The custom, unique, Esmerald way is placed here within these docs.

**Main features include:**

* SQLAlchemy sync/async engines
* Esmerald integration
* [Saffier][saffier] support
* Modern UI using Tabler

## Installation

```shell
$ pip install esmerald-admin
```

## Quickstart

Saffier is a very powerfull ORM as mentioned before and built on the top of SQLAlchemy core but
also extremely flexible allowing to use the models in a `declarative` way, which is the way
SQLAdmin is expecting to use.

This makes Saffier unique since you can use the declarative models for the admin and the core
models for anything else.

See the [declarative models][saffier_declarative] for more details on this.

Let us create a some Saffier models first. This example assumes you use the [contrib user][https://esmerald.dev/databases/saffier/models/]
from Esmerald.

!!! Warning
    Using the user provided by Esmerald is **not mandatory** and you can use your own design.
    The documentation uses the one provided by Esmerald as it is easier to explain and use.

```python
{!> ../docs_src/quickstart/models.py !}
```

**Now using with Esmerald**

Saffier, as mentioned before, has the [declarative models][saffier_declarative] ready to be used.
These models are **only used for the admin**.

```python
{!> ../docs_src/quickstart/app.py !}
```

Or if you want some more "organised".

=== "Settings"

    ```python title="myproject/configs/settings.py"
    {!> ../docs_src/quickstart/organised/settings.py !}
    ```

=== "Models"

    ```python title="myproject/apps/accounts/models.py"
    {!> ../docs_src/quickstart/organised/models.py !}
    ```

=== "Admin"

    ```python title="myproject/admin.py"
    {!> ../docs_src/quickstart/organised/admin.py !}
    ```

=== "Application"

    ```python title="myproject/app.py"
    {!> ../docs_src/quickstart/organised/app.py !}
    ```

Now visiting `/admin/` (with slash at the end) on your browser you can see the Esmerald admin interface.

## Important

As mentioned before, Esmerald admin is built on the top of [SQLAdmin][esmerald_admin]. Besides some
unique features for Esmerald with Saffier that are documented here, **everything else should be checked**
**in the [SQLAdmin][sqladmin] official documentation** as it works exactly the same.

Massive thanks to the creator of the underlying package!
